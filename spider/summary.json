        "summary": "\" The Amazigh tribes built these ancient structures from the mountains around us , \" says key keeper Hassan Louz , as he pushes open a palm - wood door to reveal the labyrinthine vaults of one of Morocco ' s oldest igoudar – storehouses built by the region ' s Indigenous tribes centuries ago to protect their most valuable possessions . Widely regarded by historians as among the world ' s oldest banking systems , igoudar eventually became the centre of Amazigh influence in the region , acting as spaces of governance , trade and debate as well as communal storehouses . The Amazigh tribes first built igoudar to store their community ' s treasures ; not only the grains , nuts , oils and dates harvested from southern Morocco ' s fertile valleys ; but also the woven carpets , silver jewellery and legal documents belonging to local families . Their position – situated strategically amid the rocky outcrops of the Anti - Atlas Mountains – was carefully chosen to provide protection against the dangers of the surrounding desert : looting bandits , drought and warring tribes . Over the years , underground water tanks , apiaries and blacksmiths ’ forges were incorporated into the fortified structures as the once - nomadic Amazigh tribes increasingly invested in local igoudar as impregnable citadels for their survival .   \""
