        "summary": "In November 2016 , Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky was so excited by Donald Trump ’ s victory , and so sure that it would transform US - Russian relations , he splashed out on 132 bottles of bubbly down at the Duma , Russia ’ s parliament , and partied away ( in his party offices ) in front of the TV cameras . The day after Trump ' s surprise White House win , Margarita Simonyan , editor - in - chief of state channel RT , tweeted her intention to drive around Moscow with an American flag in her car window . And I ’ ll never forget the moment a Russian official told me she had smoked a cigar and drunk a bottle of champagne ( yes , MORE champagne ) to toast Trump winning . “ The value of Trump was that he never preached on human rights in Russia , ” explains Konstantin Remchukov , the owner and editor - in - chief of newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta . “ Trump introduced the heaviest sanctions against Russia at that time , ” recalls Remchukov ."
