"content": ["Piece of advice for you - never buy a huge amount of champagne unless you\u2019re absolutely certain it\u2019s worth celebrating.", "In November 2016, Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky was so excited by Donald Trump\u2019s victory, and so sure that it would transform US-Russian relations, he splashed out on 132 bottles of bubbly down at the Duma, Russia\u2019s parliament, and partied away (in his party offices) in front of the TV cameras.", "He wasn\u2019t the only one celebrating. ", "The day after Trump's surprise White House win, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of state channel RT, tweeted her intention to drive around Moscow with an American flag in her car window.", "And I\u2019ll never forget the moment a Russian official told me she had smoked a cigar and drunk a bottle of champagne (yes, MORE champagne) to toast Trump winning.", "In Moscow, expectations were high that Trump would scrap sanctions against Russia; perhaps, even, recognise the Crimean Peninsula, annexed from Ukraine, as part of Russia.", "\u201cThe value of Trump was that he never preached on human rights in Russia,\u201d explains Konstantin Remchukov, the owner and editor-in-chief of newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta.", "It didn\u2019t take long for all that fizz to go flat.", "\u201cTrump introduced the heaviest sanctions against Russia at that time,\u201d recalls Remchukov.", "\u201cBy the end of his term, a lot of people were disappointed in his presidency.\"", "Which is why, eight years on - publicly at least - Russian officials are more cautious about the prospect of a second Trump term.", "President Vladimir Putin has even come out and backed the Democratic Party candidate, although that \"endorsement\" was widely interpreted as a Kremlin joke (or Kremlin trolling).", "Putin claimed he liked Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201cinfectious\u201d laugh.", "But you don\u2019t need to be a seasoned political pundit to understand that out on the campaign trail it\u2019s what Trump has been saying, not Harris, that\u2019s guaranteed to put a smile on Putin\u2019s face.", "For instance, Trump\u2019s criticism of the scale of US military assistance for Ukraine, his apparent reluctance to blame Putin for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion and, during the presidential debate, his refusal to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.", "By contrast, Kamala Harris has argued that support for Ukraine is in America\u2019s \u201cstrategic interest\u201d and she has referred to Putin as \u201ca murderous dictator\u201d.", "Not that Russian state TV has been particularly complimentary about her either. A few weeks ago one of Russia\u2019s most acerbic news anchors was completely dismissive of Harris\u2019s political abilities. He suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cookery show.", "There\u2019s another possible outcome that may well suit the Kremlin - a super tight election, followed by a contested result. An America consumed by post-election chaos, confusion and confrontation would have less time to focus on foreign affairs, including the war in Ukraine.", "US-Russian relations soured under Barack Obama, grew worse under Donald Trump and, in the words of the recently departed Russian ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov, they are \u201cfalling apart\u201d under Joe Biden.", "Washington lays the blame fully on Moscow.", "It was just eight months after Putin and Biden met for a summit in Geneva that the Kremlin leader ordered the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.", "Not only did the Biden administration send a tsunami of sanctions Russia\u2019s way, but US military aid has been crucial in helping Kyiv survive more than two-and-a-half years of Russia\u2019s war. Amongst the advanced weaponry America has supplied Ukraine are Abrams tanks and HIMARS rocket systems.", "It\u2019s hard to believe now that there was a time, not so long ago, when Russia and the US pledged to work as partners to strengthen global security.", "In the late 1980s Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev formed a geo-political double-act to slash their countries\u2019 respective nuclear arsenals.", "If there was one thing Reagan seemed to enjoy as much as nuclear disarmament it was reciting Russian proverbs to Gorbachev in broken Russian (\u201cNever buy 132 bottles of champagne unless you\u2019re certain it\u2019s worth celebrating\u201d would have been a good one).", "In 1991 the First Ladies of the USSR and America, Raisa Gorbacheva and Barbara Bush, unveiled an unusual monument in Moscow - a mother duck with eight ducklings.", "It was a replica of a sculpture in Boston Public Gardens and was presented to Moscow as a symbol of friendship between Soviet and American children.", "It\u2019s still popular with Muscovites today. Russians flock to Novodevichy Park to pose for photos with the bronze birds, although few visitors know the back story of superpower \u201cduck diplomacy\u201d.", "Like US-Russian relations themselves, the ducks have taken a few knocks. On one occasion some of them were stolen and had to be replaced.", "It\u2019s to the Moscow mallard and her ducklings I head to find out what Russians think of America and of the US election.", "\u201cI want America to disappear,\u201d says angry angler Igor who\u2019s fishing in a nearby pond. \u201cIt has started so many wars in the world. The US was our enemy in Soviet times and it still is. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s president.\u201d", "America as Russia\u2019s eternal enemy - that\u2019s a worldview often reflected here in the state media. Is Igor so angry because he gets his news from Russian TV? Or perhaps it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t caught many fish.", "Most of the people I chat to here do not see America as an evil adversary.", "\u201cI\u2019m all for peace and friendship,\u201d says Svetlana. \u201cBut my friend in America is scared to call me now. Maybe there\u2019s no free speech there. Or, perhaps, it\u2019s here in Russia that there\u2019s no freedom of speech. I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "\u201cOur countries and our two peoples should be friends,\u201d says Nikita, \u201cwithout wars and without competing to see who has more missiles. I prefer Trump. When he was president there weren\u2019t any big wars.\u201d", "Despite the differences between Russia and America there is one thing the two countries have in common - they have always had male presidents. ", "Can Russians ever see that changing?", "\u201cI think it would be great if a woman became president,\u201d says Marina.", "\u201cI would be happy to vote for a woman president here [in Russia]. I\u2019m not saying it would be better or worse. But it would be different.\u201d", "North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.
